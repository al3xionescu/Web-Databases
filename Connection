We want to connect to a MySQL database with PHP and we will do this with MySQLi extension.


<?php
$servername = "localhost"
$username = "username"
$password = "password"
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password);
if ($conn->connect_error) {
  die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
echo "Connected successfully";
?>
